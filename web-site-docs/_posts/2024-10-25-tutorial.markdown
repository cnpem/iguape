## Visuals
The GUI has two tabs and concentrate its features in a button panel at the bottom of the window. The XRD Data tab displays the diffraction patterns stacked by a user-defined offset. The Peak Fitting tab displays the data obtained through peak fitting of the XRD patterns on the selected 2theta interval.

## Usage
# **Initialization**
The first step, once Iguape is initialized, is to select a folder to monitor. This can be done by clicking in the **Folder** option at the upper right corner of the window. It's important that the selected folder contains the **iguape_fileslist.txt** file. It is though this text document, that Iguape can read the XRD data available at the Folder.

**OBS:** When using Windows, the contents inside the selected folder may not appear when in the file explorer for choosing the desired folder. This is just a visual bug of the interface. If the folder has the desired files (including the iguape_fileslist.txt), the program will work just fine.  
# **Custom Vizualization**
Iguape offers tools for custom visualization of the XRD patterns. These include: XRD patterns offset, 2theta and temperature/measure order masks, zoom, pan and figure saving.

# **Peak Fit**
Peak fitting is available in Iguape, helping the analysis of sample evotution during _in situ_ experiments. When the Peak Fit button is pressed, a new window will be opened. The user, then, can configure the fitting model and have a preview of the best fit achieved by Iguape.
