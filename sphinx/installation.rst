Linux and macOS
---------------

On Linux and macOS, Iguape can be installed via the command line. Follow these steps:

It's always better to setup a python environment before installing any package. I you are familiar with Anaconda, you can create a conda environment (with python 3.10 or higher)
and then install iguape via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   conda env create -n iguape-env python=3.11
   conda activate iguape-env
   pip install iguape
   iguape

Alternatively you can write a `environment.yml` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: iguape-env
   channels: 
      - conda-forge
   dependencies:
      - python = 3.11
      - pip:
         - iguape

And then, run in your conda prompt (or base environment):
